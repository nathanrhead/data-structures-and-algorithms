# Singly Linked List
Code 401, code challenge 05: this is our introduction to singly linked lists. I expect this to get much harder.

## Challenge
Create an empty linked list and then populate it with nodes added to the head; search for the presence of a value in the list; output a string of objects representing the value of each node.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O is either 0(1) or 0(n).

## API
Insert: either a node as the first entry into an empty list or as an additional entry at the head of the list.

Append: add a node at the end of the list (no test yest for this, because there was no requirement).

Includes: search for the presence of a given value in the list, returning true if it is found and false if not.

toString: return a string of objects of all values in the list, including null (to indicate the end of the list).
