# FIFO Animal Shelter

- This is the code challenge for class 13 of Code Fellows 401.
- The task is to write a function that receives a string of opening and closing brackets (and possibly extraneous characters) and returns true in the event that the opening brackets match the closing brackets in type and number; otherwise, return false.

## Challenge

- Whiteboard with a partner the solution, determining approaches to testing and Big O for space and time.
- Write the code and tests for it.
- Timebox of two hours.

## Approach & Efficiency

- Big O for space: 0(1).
- Big 0 for time: 0(n), because of the for loop and the n number of times the loop may run before getting to the end.
