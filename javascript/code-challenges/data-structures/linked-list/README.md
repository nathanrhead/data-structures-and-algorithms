# Singly Linked Lists

## [Challenge 05](index.js)
### [Whiteboard 05 - None]

Create an empty linked list and then populate it with nodes added to the head; search for the presence of a value in the list; output a string of objects representing the value of each node.

## [Challenge 06](index.js)
### ![Whiteboard 06](../code-challenges/assets/code-challenge06.png)

Add methods to the linkedList class that (a) append a new node to the end of the list; (b) insert a new node before a node with a given value; (c) insert a new node after a node with a give value. Write tests for each method.

## [Challenge 07](index.js)
### ![Whiteboard 07](../code-chalenges/assets/code-challenge07.png)

Find the node k places from the tail (with the last node occupying the zero position).

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O is either 0(1) or 0(n).

## API

- Insert: either a node as the first entry into an empty list or as an additional entry at the head of the list.

- Includes: search for the presence of a given value in the list, returning true if it is found and false if not.

- toString: return a string of objects of all values in the list, including null (to indicate the end of the list).

- Append: add a node at the end of the list.

- insertBefore: add a node before a given node.

- insertAfter: add a node after a given node.
